# 08-722 Data Structures for Application Programmer #

### Course Description  ###

This course is an introduction to Data Structures and a few fundamental algorithms for students with some prior programming experience (functions, loops, and arrays mainly in Java). It covers the conceptual and implementation views of most common data structures and algorithms. It also goes over the Java Collections (such as List, ArrayList, LinkedList, Set, HashSet, TreeSet, Map, HashMap, TreeMap, and PriorityQueue) to solidify the understanding of data structures. There is an introduction to the analysis of algorithms that operate on them. Following learning-by-doing methodology, there will be many repetitions of writing code and reviews of the items covered in lectures. 

### Objectives  ###
- Acquire an understanding (design, analysis, and implementation) of basic data structures and their major operations and fundamental algorithms. 
- Provide an introduction to algorithm efficiency and complexity in terms of running time and space. 

### Background and Motivation ###

As a Java application programmer, you may often use the Collections Framework that provides a well-designed set of interfaces and classes for storing and manipulating groups of data. But, you may not really think about what is in there and how it works. This course is designed to take a closer look at the Interfaces and Classes in the Framework so that you can have a better understanding of core data structures and major operations on them. Also, having a good habit such as following a good coding style and adding meaningful comments as you write a program is a great skill to learn as a programmer. Thus, examples in lectures and labs will demonstrate a better, if not the best, habit. There will be many practices to write code on papers in lectures, labs, and homework assignments.
