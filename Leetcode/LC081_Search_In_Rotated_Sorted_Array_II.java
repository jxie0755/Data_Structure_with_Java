 * P081 Search in Rotated Sorted Array II
 * Medium
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
 * (i.e., [0,0,1,2,2,5,6] might become [2,5,6,0,0,1,2]).
 * You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return true, otherwise return false.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Follow up:
 * This is a follow up problem to Search in Rotated Sorted Array, where nums may contain duplicates.
 * Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
 * <p>
 * before: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6] might become [3,4,5,6,0,1,2]).
 * now:    [0,0,1,2,2,5,6] might become [2,5,6,0,0,1,2]
