 * p088 Merge Sorted Array
 * Easy
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * The number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 are m and n respectively.
 * You may assume that nums1 has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from nums2.
 * <p>
 * Key is to modified nums1, not returning a new list
