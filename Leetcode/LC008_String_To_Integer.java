/**
 * P008 String to Integer (atoi)
 * Medium
 *
 *
 * Implement atoi which converts a string to an integer.
 * The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found.
 * Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible,
 * and interprets them as a numerical value.
 *
 * If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed. (Example 4)
 * If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned.
 *
 * Note:
 * Only the space character ' ' is considered as whitespace character.
 * Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. If the numerical value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX (2^31 − 1) or INT_MIN (−2^31) is returned.
